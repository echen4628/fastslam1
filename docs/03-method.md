SLAM algorithms are a good choice for our task of localizing a robot within an unknown environment. For our project, we choose to use the FastSLAM algorithm. FastSLAM was developed by _____ (cite) and it showed promising results


One relatively successful SLAM algorithm is FastSLAM

Our goal of mapping an environment using a robot and tracking the position of the robot simultanously leads us 

# FastSLAM



As the name suggests, SLAM is a category of algorithms that allows an agent to track its position and map its surroundings simulaneous. Popular localization methods such as the Kalman filter and the particle filter have two stages. A prediction step and a correction step. During the prediction step, sensor measurements ... explain how mapping is similar ... explain that slam does both at the same time by do each step one after the other.
